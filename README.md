# Lucy

School Project made in Unity. Lucy is a 2D game about friendship and betrayals where you must play a series of games to survive with 4 other players.
The goal was to build a type of alternative controller for our game according to alt.ctrl.GDC's rules and setup an environment to immerse our players into the game's setting.

Stuff used for our alternative controllers and the environment :

- Led Buttons 
- Cardboard 
- Projector
- Arduino 
- Lights

Main work done : 

- Musics & Sounds
- Mini-games
- Connect the alternative controllers to Unity
